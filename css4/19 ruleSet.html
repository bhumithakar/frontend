    Definitions: A table of instructions used by a controlled interface to determine what data is allowable and how the data is handled between interconnected systems.


    In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), a rule set is a combination of selectors and declarations that define how a specific set of HTML elements should be styled. It's the fundamental structure that allows you to apply styles to your web page's elements.

        A rule set consists of the following components:

            1.  Selectors: Selectors are patterns that define which HTML elements you want to style. Selectors can be based on element types, IDs, classes, attributes, relationships between elements, and more. They determine which elements the styles within the rule set will be applied to.

            2.  Declarations: Declarations are pairs of property-value pairs that define the specific styles you want to apply to the selected elements. A declaration includes a CSS property (such as color, font-size, background-color, etc.) followed by a value (such as blue, 16px, #FF0000, etc.).
