â€¢ 13.   What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?
ans.

    <!-- 1.  Inline CSS: This involves adding CSS directly within the HTML elements using the style attribute. It's not recommended for larger projects due to its limited maintainability and separation of concerns. -->

        <p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is a paragraph with inline CSS.</p>


    <!-- 2.  Internal CSS: This method involves embedding CSS within the <style> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document. This allows you to define styles for specific elements on that page -->

        <head>
            <style>
                p {
                    color: blue;
                    font-size: 16px;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>This is a paragraph with internal CSS.</p>
        </body>


    <!-- 3.  External CSS: This is the recommended and most common method. It involves creating a separate .css file and linking it to your HTML document using the <link> tag within the <head> section. -->
            
            /* styles.css */
        p {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 16px;
        }


        <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>This is a paragraph with external CSS.</p>
        </body>

    <!-- 4.  CSS Frameworks: Frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, and Materialize provide pre-designed and pre-styled components that you can use to quickly build responsive and visually appealing web pages. They often come with their own CSS files that you include in your HTML.

    5.  Preprocessors: CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less allow you to write CSS in a more organized and efficient manner. You write code in a preprocessor language, which then gets compiled into regular CSS.

    6.  CSS-in-JS: This approach involves writing CSS using JavaScript. Libraries like styled-components and Emotion allow you to define styles in JavaScript code, which is then converted into corresponding CSS during runtime.

    7.  CSS Modules: In this approach, CSS files are treated as modular components. Class names are scoped to the components they are used in, reducing the risk of style conflicts.

    8.  Post-Processors: Tools like PostCSS can be used to apply additional transformations and optimizations to your CSS after it's been written, helping improve performance and maintainability. -->
