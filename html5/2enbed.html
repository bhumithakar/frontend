<!-- â€¢ How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
ans.

Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called index. html . Add <audio> and <video> elements to the page; make them display the default browser controls. Give both of them <source> elements so that browsers will find the audio format they support best and load it.

    To embed audio and video in a webpage, you can use the <audio> and <video> elements in HTML5. These elements allow you to add multimedia content to your webpage with ease. Here's how you can embed audio and video:

        Embedding Audio:
        
        To embed audio on your webpage, use the <audio> element. Here's an example:
        
            <audio controls>
                <source src="audiofile.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                Your browser does not support the audio element.
            </audio>

    
        Embedding Video:

        To embed video on your webpage, use the <video> element. Here's an example:

            <video controls>
                <source src="videofile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video element.
            </video>

        Similar to audio, the controls attribute adds video controls to the player. Replace "videofile.mp4" with the actual path to your video file. The <source> element specifies the video file's source and type. The text inside the <video> element is displayed if the browser does not support the <video> element.
