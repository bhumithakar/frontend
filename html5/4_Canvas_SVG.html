â€¢ Canvas and SVG tags
ans.

1. <canvas> Element:

    The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript. The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

    The <canvas> element provides a bitmap-based drawing surface that allows you to create and manipulate graphics using JavaScript. It's suitable for creating dynamic and interactive visual content, such as animations, games, and custom graphics.
    
    Here's a simple example of using the <canvas> element:
        <canvas id="myCanvas" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
        <script>
            const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
            const context = canvas.getContext("2d");
            context.fillStyle = "blue";
            context.fillRect(50, 50, 150, 100);
        </script>


2. SVG (<svg>) Element:

    The <svg> element is a scalable vector graphics format that allows you to create graphics using XML markup. It's resolution-independent, meaning that it scales perfectly without losing quality. SVG is particularly useful for static graphics, logos, icons, and illustrations.
    
    Here's a simple example of using the <svg> element:

        <svg width="100" height="100">
            <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
        </svg>
