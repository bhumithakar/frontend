ans.

HTML Tags:
HTML tags are markup elements that define the structure and content of a web page. 
They are the building blocks of an HTML document and are used to indicate the beginning and end of HTML elements. 
HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets ("<" and ">") and are case-insensitive, meaning they can be written in uppercase or lowercase.
    -> There are two types of HTML tags:
        a. Opening Tags  
        b. Closing Tags
    
HTML Attributes:
HTML attributes are used to provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements. 
They are placed within the opening tag of an element and are defined using the following syntax: attribute="value".
Attributes consist of a name and a corresponding value.

Attributes can serve various purposes, such as specifying the source of an image, setting the width of an element, 
providing alternative text for images, defining links, and more.
    -> Example of using attributes in HTML tags:
        `href`, `target`, `src`, `alt`, `type`, `name`, and `placeholder` are attributes.

<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example Website</a>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape">
<input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your username">
