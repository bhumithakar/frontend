ans.

HTML links are hyperlinks.

• To create a hyperlink (or link) in HTML, you use the <a> (anchor) element. The <a> element is used to define a hyperlink that, when 
    clicked, will navigate the user to another location, which can be another web page, a file, or an anchor within the same page.
    <a href="URL">Link Text</a>

• The href attribute specifies the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to which the link points. It can be an absolute URL 
  (e.g., https://www.example.com) or a relative URL (e.g., page.html).
• The text between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag is the visible link text that the user clicks on.
Here's an example of how to create a hyperlink to the OpenAI website:

    <a href="https://www.openai.com">Visit OpenAI</a>

• When you insert this code into an HTML document, the text "Visit OpenAI" will appear as a clickable link. When users click on it, 
  they will be taken to the OpenAI website.

    You can also create links to other pages within your own website using relative URLs:

        <a href="about.html">About Us</a>
        <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a>

• In this example, clicking on the "About Us" link would take the user to the about.html page, and clicking on the "Contact Us" link 
  would take them to the contact.html page.
