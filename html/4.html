HTML entities are the reserved characters that are used in the HTML document. They are not present in your standard keyboard. 
They provide a wide range of characters, allowing you to add icons, geometric shapes, mathematical operators, and so on.

An HTML entity is used to display invisible characters and reserved characters that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code. 
It is a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ).

    -> Here are some common examples of HTML entities:

        &lt;: Represents the less-than sign <.
        &gt;: Represents the greater-than sign >.
        &amp;: Represents the ampersand &.
        &quot;: Represents a double quotation mark ".
        &apos;: Represents an apostrophe '. (Note: This entity is not supported in HTML 4, but it is supported in HTML5.)
        &nbsp;: Represents a non-breaking space.
