6.  What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.
ans.

In HTML, the 'class' attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an element. The class attribute allows 
you to define a group or category that an element belongs to. This class name can then be referenced in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
to apply specific styles or behaviors to all elements with the same class name.

The 'class' attribute does not affect the behavior or functionality of the element itself; it is primarily used for styling and applying CSS rules.

    Here's an example of how the 'class' attribute is used:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Class Attribute Example</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS rules for elements with class name 'highlight' */
        .highlight {
        background-color: yellow;
        font-weight: bold;
        }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1 class="highlight">Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a <span class="highlight">paragraph</span> with some highlighted text.</p>
    <p class="highlight">This is another paragraph with the class name 'highlight'.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
