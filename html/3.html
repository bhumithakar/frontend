ans.

Void elements, also known as self-closing elements or empty elements, are HTML elements that do not require a separate closing tag. 
They are used to insert content into a web page, but they don't have any content of their own. 
In HTML, void elements are written in a self-closing format with a forward slash at the end of the opening tag.

A void element is an element whose content model never allows it to have contents under any circumstances. 
Void elements can have attributes. The following is a complete list of the void elements in HTML
